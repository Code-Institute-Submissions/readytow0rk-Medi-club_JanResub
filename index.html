      Meditation reduces stress and anxiety, makes you physically fit, improves memory, and helps you think more clearly.  but this is only on condition that you have been meditating for some time and not just started, so you need to start right now.

      Meditation is a practice in which an individual uses a technique – such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.
    <br>
      Meditation is practiced in numerous religious traditions. The earliest records of meditation (dhyana) are found in the Upanishads, and meditation plays a salient role in the contemplative repertoire of Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism. Since the 19th century, Asian meditative techniques have spread to other cultures where they have also found application in non-spiritual contexts, such as business and health.
      <br>     
      Meditation may significantly reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and pain, and enhance peace, perception, self-concept, and well-being. Research is ongoing to better understand the effects of meditation on health (psychological, neurological, and cardiovascular) and other areas.
      How we start ? 
      <br>The easiest thing to focus on is your own breath. You can simply notice the sensations of your breath going in and out of your nose. Anytime your mind wanders, then gently bring it back to the breath.</div>
      <div class="partt">  It is completely normal for the mind to wander a lot, just keep bringing it back to the breath.You do not need to change the breath, or breathe more deeply. Just notice the sensations in your nose as you breathe normally.
      
        <br>It helps to stay as still physically as possible throughout the meditation, and in addition, it can help to keep your eyes under your closed eyelids still also. Just let your eyes sink into their sockets and remain stationary.
     
      <br>Start with whatever amount of time is comfortable and gradually build up the length of time that you sit. You may discover that longer meditations have unique effects, but allow yourself to increase the time by just a few minutes every week or so, to allow your body and mind to adjust, and to build a steady habit without getting overwhelmed or discouraged. Note added: Recent neuroscience research has shown that there is much more benefit to longer meditation sessions up to an hour or more at a time. This may seem like a lot to someone just getting started, but once you experience the more powerful effects of longer meditations, you may find that you want to meditate for longer at a time. Definitely, I would suggest doing one long meditation each day instead of two shorter periods of meditation.
